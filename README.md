### Hi there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643515231/12491/waveboi.gif?1643515231" width="25"/>
I'm **Chloé**, a Data Scientist from Maastricht, The Netherlands.

### My Interests and Background 🚀

I'm passionate about **data science**, with a special focus on:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🗣️
- **Computer Vision** 👁️

I thrive on building data-driven solutions that leverage AI and machine learning to solve complex problems. I enjoy exploring cutting-edge research in these areas and integrating them into practical applications.

### Work Experience 💼

- **Previous**: Research Assistant at [Maastricht Law & Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab), where I contributed to a [published paper](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/65592) titled *Centrality Scores and Precedent Value in Legal Network Analysis*. The research explored the use of centrality measures to calculate the precedent value in citation networks of judgments, particularly focusing on the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). We found that various network centrality measures correlated reasonably with proxies for precedent value, with Degree being a stable indicator across networks. 📜
- **Current**: Data Scientist at **Mercedes Benz Customer Assistance Center** (CAC) in Maastricht. 🚗 Here, I work on delivering high-quality data products and optimizing customer experience through data.

### Hobbies & Side Projects 🎮

Outside of work, I’m constantly exploring new technologies and developing my skills through personal projects. Some of my favorite activities include:
- **3D Modelling and Printing**: Crafting and bringing digital designs to life using 3D printers 🖨️
- **Gaming**: Unwinding with video games, from strategy to adventure
- **Personal Coding Projects**: Experimenting with AI, NLP, and keeping up to date with the latest tech developments 📈
